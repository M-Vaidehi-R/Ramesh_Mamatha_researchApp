# Accessible Media Application

## Project Description:


The objective of this project is to create a fully accessible Node/express multimedia application with two multimedia: an audio and a video. The application must be designed with accessibility in mind, incorporating standard features such as size, visual contrast, tabbing, Aria attribute etc. The application must be deployed using routing with Node and Express to separate the audio and video pages. Each page should be made with the idea that any user regardless of their accessibility challenges should be able to enjoy it. 


## Installation:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install Node.js and NPM if you haven't already.
* Install dependencies with npm install.
* Run the server with npm start.

## Features:
The Accessible Media Application includes the following features:

* Keyboard navigation for improved accessibility.
* Keyboard shortcuts for custom buttons, allowing users to interact with the media player without using a mouse.
* Closed captioning for both video and audio files, providing access to users with hearing impairments.
* ARIA attributes for improved screen reader support.
* Visually pleasing design for optimal user experience across devices.

Watching a kitten fumbling around, 

Unknown Speaker  0:10  
it might feel as if you've never encountered anything so devastatingly adorable. 

Unknown Speaker  0:17  
In your mortal life. You may want to pet it soft fur and kiss its tiny head.

Unknown Speaker  0:25  
 But you may also feel the conflicting urge to squeeze, or smash the kitten, maybe even stuffed it in your mouth. 

Unknown Speaker  0:36  
However, you don't, and you might be appalled by yourself.

Unknown Speaker  0:40  
 But this urge which psychologists call cute aggression, 

Unknown Speaker  0:45  
is a surprisingly common one, estimated to affect about half of all adults. 

Unknown Speaker  0:52  
To better understand this peculiar phenomenon. Let's start with what cuteness is.

Unknown Speaker  0:58  
 In 1943 One scientists created a baby schema that identified key features associated with cuteness like plump cheeks, large eyes and short limbs. 

Unknown Speaker  1:11  
These characteristics associated with many young animals were placed in opposition with those perceived as less cute. 

Unknown Speaker  1:20  
Decades of study have since indicated that this baby schema reliably tracks

Unknown Speaker  1:25  
 with how people perceive cuteness. 

Unknown Speaker  1:28  
When study participants see images containing more features that the baby's schema pinpoints as cute, 

Unknown Speaker  1:34  
they tend to look at them longer and more often,

Unknown Speaker  1:38  
 and the photos appear to stimulate brain regions associated with emotion, and reward. 

Unknown Speaker  1:45  
Cuteness is also thought to influence behavior. 

Unknown Speaker  1:49  
In a 2009 study, participants performed better at the game operation, which demands precise careful movements when shown cute images beforehand. 

Unknown Speaker  2:00  
The results of another study indicated that people use recycling bins more 

Unknown Speaker  2:04  
when they have cute images on them. And the fact that cuteness hijacks our emotions is certainly not lost on authorities and advertisers.

Unknown Speaker  2:15  
 But why does cuteness have this hold on us?

Unknown Speaker  2:19  
 It's nearly impossible to know for sure. But one theory is that cute things simply make us want to nurture them. 

Unknown Speaker  2:26  
Because human babies are relatively helpless on their own. It's hypothesized that evolution favored infants who are perceived as cute and inspired more care and interaction.

Unknown Speaker  2:38  
 And being acutely sensitive to cuteness. were tuned into similar features in other species. 

Unknown Speaker  2:45  
In fact, as we domesticated animals, their appearances tended to change to

Unknown Speaker  2:51  
 some scientists have noted a phenomenon called domestication syndrome, 

Unknown Speaker  2:56  
where certain animals appear to have gradually adopted more juvenile features as they became more docile. 

Unknown Speaker  3:05  
One theory is that these physical changes are regulated by an embryonic structure called the neural crest. 

Unknown Speaker  3:12  
It helps determine how some of a developing embryo cells differentiate and where they go.

Unknown Speaker  3:18  
 Delaying or inhibiting the arrival of the cells in certain areas of the body can result in an under development of the pituitary and adrenal glands, which govern fear and aggression.

Unknown Speaker  3:31  
 It can also lead to physical characteristics like floppy ears, shorter snouts and smaller jaws.

Unknown Speaker  3:39  
 This is one idea of how selecting for behavioral characteristics like friendliness, may also select for more juvenile, cuter, physical traits. 

Unknown Speaker  3:50  
Basically, as humans bred and domesticated, docile dogs,

Unknown Speaker  3:55  
 we seem to have made some breeds look more like babies. 

Unknown Speaker  4:00  
Some scientists theorize that we may have even domesticated ourselves. 

Unknown Speaker  4:06  
The thinking here is that as ancient humans formed larger, more cooperative groups they selected for friendlier individuals. 

Unknown Speaker  4:15  
This may have then led to some of the physical characteristics that distinguish us from our closest evolutionary cousins, like smaller round skulls, and subtler brow ridges. 

Unknown Speaker  4:26  
But if cuteness is related to nurturing and decreased aggression, why would anyone ever want to squeeze or bite cute things? 

Unknown Speaker  4:38  
Well, cute. Aggression is importantly not linked to the actual intention to do harm. 

Unknown Speaker  4:44  
Instead, it seems to result from emotional overload. 

Unknown Speaker  4:49  
Some scientists think that cute things elicit such positive emotions from certain people that the experience becomes overwhelming. 

Unknown Speaker  4:59  
They hype prophesized that slightly aggressive discordant thoughts are the brains way of putting the brakes on and regulating those intense feelings. 

Unknown Speaker  5:09  
Not getting you to actually eat a kitten. 

Unknown Speaker  5:13  
Cuteness can come off as a frivolous, innocent quality, but it wields immense, consequential power. 

Unknown Speaker  5:22  
Not to be aggressive, but cuteness kind of runs the world.

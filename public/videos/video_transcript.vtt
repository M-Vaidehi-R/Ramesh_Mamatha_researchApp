00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.267
Watching a kitten fumbling around,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.120
it might feel as if you've never encountered anything so devastatingly adorable.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.864
In your mortal life. You may want to pet it soft fur and kiss its tiny head.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.168
But you may also feel the conflicting urge to squeeze, or smash the kitten, maybe even stuffed it in your mouth.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.712
However, you don't, and you might be appalled by yourself.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.520
But this urge which psychologists call cute aggression,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.800
is a surprisingly common one, estimated to affect about half of all adults.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.184
To better understand this peculiar phenomenon. Let's start with what cuteness is.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
In 1943 One scientists created a baby schema that identified key features associated with cuteness like plump cheeks, large eyes and short limbs.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.488
These characteristics associated with many young animals were placed in opposition with those perceived as less cute.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.800
Decades of study have since indicated that this baby schema reliably tracks

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.267
with how people perceive cuteness.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.976
When study participants see images containing more features that the baby's schema pinpoints as cute,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.072
they tend to look at them longer and more often,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.440
and the photos appear to stimulate brain regions associated with emotion, and reward.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.008
Cuteness is also thought to influence behavior.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In a 2009 study, participants performed better at the game operation, which demands precise careful movements when shown cute images beforehand.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.976
The results of another study indicated that people use recycling bins more

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
when they have cute images on them. And the fact that cuteness hijacks our emotions is certainly not lost on authorities and advertisers.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.867
But why does cuteness have this hold on us?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.976
It's nearly impossible to know for sure. But one theory is that cute things simply make us want to nurture them.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Because human babies are relatively helpless on their own. It's hypothesized that evolution favored infants who are perceived as cute and inspired more care and interaction.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.824
And being acutely sensitive to cuteness. were tuned into similar features in other species.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.736
In fact, as we domesticated animals, their appearances tended to change to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.480
some scientists have noted a phenomenon called domestication syndrome,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.720
where certain animals appear to have gradually adopted more juvenile features as they became more docile.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.784
One theory is that these physical changes are regulated by an embryonic structure called the neural crest.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.696
It helps determine how some of a developing embryo cells differentiate and where they go.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Delaying or inhibiting the arrival of the cells in certain areas of the body can result in an under development of the pituitary and adrenal glands, which govern fear and aggression.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.080
It can also lead to physical characteristics like floppy ears, shorter snouts and smaller jaws.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
This is one idea of how selecting for behavioral characteristics like friendliness, may also select for more juvenile, cuter, physical traits.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.584
Basically, as humans bred and domesticated, docile dogs,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.520
we seem to have made some breeds look more like babies.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.480
Some scientists theorize that we may have even domesticated ourselves.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.936
The thinking here is that as ancient humans formed larger, more cooperative groups they selected for friendlier individuals.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This may have then led to some of the physical characteristics that distinguish us from our closest evolutionary cousins, like smaller round skulls, and subtler brow ridges.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.936
But if cuteness is related to nurturing and decreased aggression, why would anyone ever want to squeeze or bite cute things?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.376
Well, cute. Aggression is importantly not linked to the actual intention to do harm.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.328
Instead, it seems to result from emotional overload.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Some scientists think that cute things elicit such positive emotions from certain people that the experience becomes overwhelming.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They hype prophesized that slightly aggressive discordant thoughts are the brains way of putting the brakes on and regulating those intense feelings.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.733
Not getting you to actually eat a kitten.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.336
Cuteness can come off as a frivolous, innocent quality, but it wields immense, consequential power.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.712
Not to be aggressive, but cuteness kind of runs the world.

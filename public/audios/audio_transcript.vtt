00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.267
Every big life lesson I've learned

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.976
how to channel my competitive fire

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.944
, how to be a supportive teammate, or partner,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.416
how to focus on what I can control and try to let go of what I can't.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.667
All of that I've learned through sports.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.976
My name is Jodie African.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.001
And I'm the host of a new show called good sport.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.096
It's a podcast about how sports can connect us with one another.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.776
Help us understand the world around us. Help us improve our

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.867
oh my god, did we make a self help podcast?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.072
Well, kinda, because I do think sports can help.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.976
And this season at least they've helped me answer some questions I've had for a long, long time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.680
Like, for instance, why does it feel like every new stadium that gets built leaves people feeling like they got fleeced?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.976
Well, it's because those deals are negotiated by people who talk like this.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.952
What should we do here? Ethically never ever comes up when you're negotiating a stadium deal?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Or another question we get into why certain places are really good at producing professional athletes, and what these hot beds can teach us about giving people a fair shot.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The baseline talent has to be there. And then we go from there. And yes, after that point, we are talking about nurture. And we are talking about belief.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Before I took on this show, I hosted the 538 politics podcast and 30 for 38 ESPN. So I've thought a lot about how sports and politics mirror each other.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Like this. I've noticed maybe you have too, that more and more the template for arguing about sports. It's kind of become the template for arguing about everything.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.464
Just take a word and say it loudly three times in a row. So preposterous, preposterous. Preposterous.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.976
Another episode this season is about my relationship with sports or no longer playing sports.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.976
What happens when you can't play at the same level you're used to?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.976
Well, I talked to soccer legend Carli Lloyd about how hard it is to hang it up.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You always have this this image in your mind of how you would like things to play out. And life doesn't always give you exactly what you want.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.976
Well, it's like sports teaching you one last lesson on the way out.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Exactly.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.976
So that's a taste of good sport.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.248
eight episodes, each one on a compelling question that sports can help us explore.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.976
We'll talk about getting in the zone, the rise of Formula One, lots, lots more.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.267
And I hope it all adds up to this,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.800
an argument from me to you,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.733
that sports really matter,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.224
that they can change our understanding of the world and ourselves.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.976
And that sports can you know, make for a fun eight part podcast that hopefully you'll listen to.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.733
That's up to you, I guess.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.696
Anyway, that's what we're up to this season on good sports from the TED audio collective.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.040
See you soon.
